# Marketing-A-B-Test-Project
Aim: To measure the difference in conversions (buying product) between an ad and a public service announcement, and to check whether this change in performance is statistically significant.

Data dictionary:

- Index: Row index
- user id: User ID (unique)
- test group: If "ad" the person saw the advertisement, if "psa" they only saw the public service announcement
- converted: If a person bought the product then True, else is False
- total ads: Amount of ads seen by person
- most ads day: Day that the person saw the biggest amount of ads
- most ads hour: Hour of day that the person saw the biggest amount of ads

Null Hypothesis: There is no statistically significant difference in the performance of conversion rates between Ad and PSA.

Simple to run: Open in Jupyter Notebook.
